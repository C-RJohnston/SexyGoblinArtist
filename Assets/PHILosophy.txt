You might want to try with your eyes open next time
This looks like my marriage : empty, pointless and a waste of my time
Maybe art isn’t for everyone
Do not quit your day job
So that’s your best, eh?
I don’t have anything to say that wouldn’t hurt your feelings
I just wish my daughter would answer my texts
I spent christmas alone last year and it was less painful than watching this
Stop being so needy and leave me alone
